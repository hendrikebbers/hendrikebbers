### Hi there 👋

I'm the founder of [Open Elements](https://github.com/openelements) and live in Dortmund, Germany.
I'm part of the board of the [Eclipse Foundation](https://www.eclipse.org) and an active member of working groups and steering committees at Eclipse Foundation like [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/de/) or [JakartaEE](https://jakarta.ee).

Since 2022 I activly contributed to the [Hedera public ledger](https://hedera.com) and helped to shift the codebase of that project to the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org). Based on that work I'm currently leading the technical steering committee (TSC) of the [Hiero](https://hiero.org) project in the [LF Dezentralized Trust](https://www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org) foundation. 

I'm became a JavaOne Rockstar 🎸, JSR / JakartaEE expert group membership and Java Champion 🤘.

Oh, and most importantly: I ❤️ boardgames, Star Wars & dogs 😄
